> Count. Forever!

Atom count is the perfect companion if you like useless stats. It increments a counter every time you press a key.

Now here's the thing it does differently - it **also** stores said value permanently. This means that you can soon enjoy your first million keypresses.

Believe it or not, but after writing this readme I'm already at over 1000.

## Installation

```bash
apm install count
```
